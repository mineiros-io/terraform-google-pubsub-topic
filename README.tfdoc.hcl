    A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) module for creating and managing a
    [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) resource on
    [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

    **_This module supports Terraform version 1
    and is compatible with the Terraform Google Provider version 4._**

    This module is part of our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework
    that enables our users and customers to easily deploy and manage reusable,
    secure, and production-grade cloud infrastructure.

              Endpoint configuration attributes. Every endpoint has a set of API
              supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects
              of the message delivery. The currently supported attribute is
              `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the
              pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data
              expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed
              message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
              based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If not present during the
              `subscriptions.create` call, it will default to the version of the
              API used to make such call. If not present during a
              `subscriptions.modifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be
              changed. `subscriptions.get` calls will always return a valid
              version, even if the subscription was created without this
              attribute. The possible values for this attribute are:

              - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
