module "terraform-google-pubsub-topic" {
  source = "git@github.com:mineiros-io/terraform-google-pubsub-topic.git?ref=v0.0.3"

  name    = "pub-sub-topic-name"
  project = "id-of-project"
}
```

## Module Argument Reference

See [variables.tf] and [examples/] for details and use-cases.

### Main Resource Configuration

- [**`name`**](#var-name): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="var-name"></a>

  The name of the Cloud Pub/Sub Topic.

- [**`project`**](#var-project): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="var-project"></a>

  The project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided, the
  provider project is used.

- [**`labels`**](#var-labels): *(Optional `map(string)`)*<a name="var-labels"></a>

  A map of labels to assign to the Pub/Sub topic.

  Default is `{}`.

- [**`kms_key_name`**](#var-kms_key_name): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="var-kms_key_name"></a>

  The resource name of the Cloud KMS CryptoKey to be used to protect
  access to messages published on this topic. Your project's PubSub
  service account
  (`service-{{PROJECT_NUMBER}}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
  must have `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` to use this
  feature. The expected format is
  `projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*`

- [**`message_retention_duration`**](#var-message_retention_duration): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="var-message_retention_duration"></a>

  Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published to the topic.
  If this field is set, messages published to the topic in the last messageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers.
  For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past.
  If this field is not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions.
  Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10 minutes.

- [**`allowed_persistence_regions`**](#var-allowed_persistence_regions): *(Optional `set(string)`)*<a name="var-allowed_persistence_regions"></a>

  A list of IDs of GCP regions where messages that are published to the
  topic may be persisted in storage. Messages published by publishers
  running in non-allowed GCP regions (or running outside of GCP
  altogether) will be routed for storage in one of the allowed regions.
  An empty list means that no regions are allowed, and is not a valid
  configuration.

  Default is `[]`.

### Extended Resource Configuration

- [**`iam`**](#var-iam): *(Optional `list(iam)`)*<a name="var-iam"></a>

  List of IAM access roles to grant to a set of identities on the topic.

  Default is `[]`.

  Each `iam` object in the list accepts the following attributes:

  - [**`role`**](#attr-iam-role): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-iam-role"></a>

    The role that should be applied. Only one
    `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding` can be used per role.
    Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

  - [**`members`**](#attr-iam-members): *(Optional `set(string)`)*<a name="attr-iam-members"></a>

    Identities that will be granted the privilege in role. Each entry
    can have one of the following values:

    - `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on
      the internet; with or without a Google account.
    - `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents
      anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service
      account.
    - `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific
      Google account. For example, `alice@gmail.com` or `joe@example.com`.
    - `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a
      service account. For example,
      `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
    - `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google
      group. For example, `admins@example.com`.
    - `domain:{domain}`: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias)
      name that represents all the users of that domain. For example,
      `google.com` or `example.com`.

    Default is `[]`.

  - [**`authoritative`**](#attr-iam-authoritative): *(Optional `bool`)*<a name="attr-iam-authoritative"></a>

    Whether to exclusively set (authoritative mode) or add
    (non-authoritative/additive mode) members to the role.

    Default is `true`.

- [**`schema`**](#var-schema): *(Optional `object(schema)`)*<a name="var-schema"></a>

  A schema is a format that messages must follow, creating a contract between publisher and subscriber that Pub/Sub will enforce.

  Example:

  ```hcl
  schema = {
    name       = "example"
    type       = "AVRO"
    encoding   = "JSON"
    definition = jsonencode({
      type = "record"
      name = "Avro"
      fields =  [
        {
          name = "StringField"
          type = "string"
        },
        {
          name = "IntField"
          type = "int"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  The `schema` object accepts the following attributes:

  - [**`id`**](#attr-schema-id): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-schema-id"></a>

    The resource ID of an existing schema to use.
    Conflicts with `schema.name` and will be ignored if `schema.name` is set.

  - [**`encoding`**](#attr-schema-encoding): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-schema-encoding"></a>

    The encoding of messages validated against schema.
    Possible values are ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED, JSON, and BINARY.

    Default is `"ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED"`.

  - [**`name`**](#attr-schema-name): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-schema-name"></a>

    The ID to use for the schema, which will become the final component of the schema's resource name.
    Conflicts with `schema.id`. If set a new schema resource will be created.

  - [**`type`**](#attr-schema-type): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-schema-type"></a>

    The type of the schema definition Default value is TYPE_UNSPECIFIED. Possible values are TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, PROTOCOL_BUFFER, and AVRO.
    Ignored if `schema.name` is not set.

  - [**`definition`**](#attr-schema-definition): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-schema-definition"></a>

    The definition of the schema. This should contain a string representing the full definition of the schema that is a valid schema definition of the type specified in type.
    Ignored if `schema.name` is not set.

- [**`subscriptions`**](#var-subscriptions): *(Optional `list(subscription)`)*<a name="var-subscriptions"></a>

  The list of the subscriptions that will be created for the PubSub
  topic.

  Default is `[]`.

  Example:

  ```hcl
  subscriptions = [
    {
      name = "my-subs"

      # subscription settings
      labels                     = {..}
      ack_deadline_seconds       = null
      message_retention_duration = "604800s"
      retain_acked_messages      = null
      filter                     = null
      enable_message_ordering    = null

      # iam access (roles to grant identities on the subscription)
      iam = [
        {
          role          = "roles/pubsub.subscriber"
          members       = [...]
          authoritative = true
        }
      ]
    },
  ]
  ```

  Each `subscription` object in the list accepts the following attributes:

  - [**`name`**](#attr-subscriptions-name): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-name"></a>

    Name of the subscription.

  - [**`labels`**](#attr-subscriptions-labels): *(Optional `map(string)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-labels"></a>

    A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.

  - [**`ack_deadline_seconds`**](#attr-subscriptions-ack_deadline_seconds): *(Optional `number`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-ack_deadline_seconds"></a>

    This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
    before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
    delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message
    is acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be
    delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull
    subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack
    deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
    `subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ackId` if
    using pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is `10`
    seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is `600` seconds
    (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of `10` seconds
    is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the
    request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber
    never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually
    redeliver the message.

  - [**`message_retention_duration`**](#attr-subscriptions-message_retention_duration): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-message_retention_duration"></a>

    How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
    backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
    `retainAckedMessages` is `true`, then this also configures the
    retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back
    in time a `subscriptions.seek` can be done. Defaults to 7 days.
    Cannot be more than 7 days (`604800s`) or less than 10 minutes
    (`600s`). A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits,
    terminated by `s`.

  - [**`retain_acked_messages`**](#attr-subscriptions-retain_acked_messages): *(Optional `bool`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-retain_acked_messages"></a>

    Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then
    messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
    they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
    `messageRetentionDuration` window.

  - [**`filter`**](#attr-subscriptions-filter): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-filter"></a>

    The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
    Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the
    filter. You can filter messages by their attributes. The maximum
    length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
    you can't modify the filter.

  - [**`enable_message_ordering`**](#attr-subscriptions-enable_message_ordering): *(Optional `bool`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-enable_message_ordering"></a>

    If `true`, messages published with the same `orderingKey` in
    `PubsubMessage` will be delivered to the subscribers in the order
    in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
    may be delivered in any order.

  - [**`expiration_policy_ttl`**](#attr-subscriptions-expiration_policy_ttl): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-expiration_policy_ttl"></a>

    A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's
    expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any
    connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the
    subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If
    `expirationPolicy` is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days
    will be used. If it is set but ttl is "", the resource never expires.
    The minimum allowed value for `expirationPolicy.ttl` is 1 day.

  - [**`dead_letter_policy`**](#attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy): *(Optional `object(dead_letter_policy)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy"></a>

    A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages
    in this subscription. If `dead_letter_policy` is not set, dead
    lettering is disabled. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated
    with this subscription's parent project (i.e.,
    `service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com)`
    must have permission to `Acknowledge()` messages on this
    subscription.

    The `dead_letter_policy` object accepts the following attributes:

    - [**`dead_letter_topic`**](#attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy-dead_letter_topic): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy-dead_letter_topic"></a>

      The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be
      published. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The Cloud
      Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
      parent project (i.e.,
      `service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
      must have permission to `Publish()` to this topic. The operation
      will fail if the topic does not exist. Users should ensure that
      there is a subscription attached to this topic since messages
      published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.

    - [**`max_delivery_attempts`**](#attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy-max_delivery_attempts): *(Optional `number`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-dead_letter_policy-max_delivery_attempts"></a>

      The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value
      must be between 5 and 100. The number of delivery attempts is
      defined as 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of times the
      acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message). A NACK
      is any call to `ModifyAckDeadline` with a 0 deadline. Note that
      client libraries may automatically extend `ack_deadlines`. This
      field will be honored on a best effort basis. If this parameter is
      0, a default value of 5 is used.

  - [**`retry_policy`**](#attr-subscriptions-retry_policy): *(Optional `object(retry_policy)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-retry_policy"></a>

    A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this
    subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This
    generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible
    for healthy subscribers. `RetryPolicy` will be triggered on NACKs or
    acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.

    The `retry_policy` object accepts the following attributes:

    - [**`minimum_backoff`**](#attr-subscriptions-retry_policy-minimum_backoff): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-retry_policy-minimum_backoff"></a>

      The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message.
      Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. A duration in seconds
      with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`.

      Example:

      ```hcl
      3.5s
      ```

    - [**`maximum_backoff`**](#attr-subscriptions-retry_policy-maximum_backoff): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-retry_policy-maximum_backoff"></a>

      The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message.
      Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. A duration in seconds
      with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`.

      Example:

      ```hcl
      3.5s
      ```

  - [**`push_config`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config): *(Optional `object(push_config)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config"></a>

    If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
    configure it. An empty `pushConfig` signifies that the subscriber will
    pull and ack messages using API methods.

    The `push_config` object accepts the following attributes:

    - [**`oidc_token`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token): *(Optional `object(oidc_token)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token"></a>

      If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as
      an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed
      message.

      The `oidc_token` object accepts the following attributes:

      - [**`service_account_email`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token-service_account_email): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token-service_account_email"></a>

        Service account email to be used for generating the OIDC token.
        The caller (for `subscriptions.create`, `subscriptions.patch`, and
        `subscriptions.modifyPushConfig` RPCs) must have the
        `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission for the service account.

      - [**`audience`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token-audience): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config-oidc_token-audience"></a>

        Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim
        identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The
        audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple
        values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info
        about the OIDC JWT token audience here:
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not
        specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.

    - [**`push_endpoint`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config-push_endpoint): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config-push_endpoint"></a>

      A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For
      example, a Webhook endpoint might use "https://example.com/push".

    - [**`attributes`**](#attr-subscriptions-push_config-attributes): *(**Required** `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-push_config-attributes"></a>

      Endpoint configuration attributes. Every endpoint has a set of API
      supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects
      of the message delivery. The currently supported attribute is
      `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the
      pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data
      expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed
      message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
      based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If not present during the
      `subscriptions.create` call, it will default to the version of the
      API used to make such call. If not present during a
      `subscriptions.modifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be
      changed. `subscriptions.get` calls will always return a valid
      version, even if the subscription was created without this
      attribute. The possible values for this attribute are:

      - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
      - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

  - [**`iam`**](#attr-subscriptions-iam): *(Optional `list(iam)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-iam"></a>

    List of IAM access roles to grant to a set of identities on the subscription.

    Default is `[]`.

    Each `iam` object in the list accepts the following attributes:

    - [**`role`**](#attr-subscriptions-iam-role): *(Optional `string`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-iam-role"></a>

      The role that should be applied. Only one
      `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding` can be used per role.
      Note that custom roles must be of the format
      `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

    - [**`members`**](#attr-subscriptions-iam-members): *(Optional `set(string)`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-iam-members"></a>

      Identities that will be granted the privilege in role. Each entry
      can have one of the following values:

      - `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on
        the internet; with or without a Google account.
      - `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents
        anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service
        account.
      - `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific
        Google account. For example, `alice@gmail.com` or `joe@example.com`.
      - `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a
        service account. For example,
        `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
      - `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google
        group. For example, `admins@example.com`.
      - `domain:{domain}`: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias)
        name that represents all the users of that domain. For example,

    - [**`authoritative`**](#attr-subscriptions-iam-authoritative): *(Optional `bool`)*<a name="attr-subscriptions-iam-authoritative"></a>

      Whether to exclusively set (authoritative mode) or add
      (non-authoritative/additive mode) members to the role.

      Default is `true`.

### Module Configuration

- [**`module_enabled`**](#var-module_enabled): *(Optional `bool`)*<a name="var-module_enabled"></a>

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
